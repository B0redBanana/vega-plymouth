## What is Plymouth?

[Plymouth](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth) is a project from Fedora and now listed among the [freedesktop.org's official resources](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/#graphicsdriverswindowsystemsandsupportinglibraries) providing a flicker-free graphical boot process. It relies on [kernel mode setting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_mode_setting) (KMS) to set the native resolution of the display as early as possible, then provides an eye-candy splash screen leading all the way up to the login manager.

## Prerequisites

To use the theme, you need to have Plymouth installed and configured on your system. For help with that, please refer to your distribution's wiki.

- [ArchWiki: Plymouth](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Plymouth) 

- [Ubuntu Wiki: Plymouth](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Plymouth)

Fedora users can also refer to the ArchWiki.
